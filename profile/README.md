# BevyFrame

The web framework that covers all your needs at once.

Start with Python,
continue with JS,
put some Rust for performance intensive tasks,
experiment with Assembly,
and finish with static HTML.
Or just stick with a language of your choice to code functions
and call them from `.bevy` pages.
Times of killing time thinking about which language to use are over,
you can switch between languages anytime without needing to rewrite all.

Official SDKs have [TheProtocols](https://theprotocols.islekcaganmert.me) included.
Deploy without thinking about server fees, scalability of databases, or persistent data security;
focus on your idea and let TheProtocols handle these for you.
